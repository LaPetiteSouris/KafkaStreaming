Because the Apache Python `avro` package is written in pure Python, it is
relatively slow. In one test case, it takes about 14 seconds to iterate through
a file of 10,000 records. By comparison, the JAVA `avro` SDK reads the same file in
1.9 seconds.

The `fastavro` library was written to offer performance comparable to the Java
library. With regular CPython, `fastavro` uses C extensions which allow it to
iterate the same 10,000 record file in 1.7 seconds. With PyPy, this drops to 1.5
seconds (to be fair, the JAVA benchmark is doing some extra JSON
encoding/decoding).

`fastavro` supports the following Python versions:

* Python 2.7
* Python 3.4
* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6
* PyPy
* PyPy3

# Documentation

Documentation is available at http://fastavro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# Installing
`fastavro` is available both on [PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi)

    pip install fastavro

and on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io) `conda` channel.

    conda install -c conda-forge fastavro

# Hacking

As recommended by Cython, the C files output is distributed. This has the
advantage that the end user does not need to have Cython installed. However it
means that every time you change `fastavro` you need to run
`make`.

### Releasing

We release both to [pypi][pypi] and to [conda-forge][conda-forge].

We assume you have [twine][twine] installed and that you've created your own
fork of [fastavro-feedstock][feedstock].

* Make sure the tests pass
* Copy the windows build artifacts for the new version from
  https://ci.appveyor.com/project/scottbelden/fastavro to the `dist` folder
* Run `make publish`
* Note the sha signature emitted at the above
* Switch to feedstock directory and edit `recipe/meta.yaml`
    - Update `version` and `sha256` variables at the top of the file
    - Run `python recipe/test_recipe.py`
    - Submit a [PR][pr]
